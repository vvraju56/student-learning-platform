REAL-TIME OVERALL PROGRESS DASHBOARD
(Course-wise Analysis Based)
🎯 What the Dashboard Shows

The Dashboard displays Overall Progress in real time, calculated from all courses together, while also showing individual course progress with course names.

The Dashboard Includes:

Overall Progress (%) – combined learning progress

Course-wise Progress List

Web Development

App Development

Game Development

Live updates while videos are playing

Progress pauses automatically when focus is lost

🧠 How Progress Is Analysed (Core Logic)

Each course contains 10 videos.

For every video, the system tracks:

Valid watch time

Completion status

Focus violations

Resume position

Only valid watch time is counted.

📌 1️⃣ Course-Wise Progress Calculation
🔹 Formula (Per Course)
Course Progress (%) =
(Completed Videos + Partial Video Progress) ÷ Total Videos × 100

🔹 Example (Web Development):

Completed videos: 4

Current video watched: 50%

Total videos: 10

(4.5 ÷ 10) × 100 = 45%


📌 This value updates every second while watching.

📌 2️⃣ Overall Progress Calculation (All Courses)
🔹 Formula:
Overall Progress (%) =
(Web % + App % + Game %) ÷ Number of Courses

🔹 Example:

Web Development: 45%

App Development: 20%

Game Development: 10%

(45 + 20 + 10) ÷ 3 = 25%


📌 This value updates in real time on the dashboard.

📊 3️⃣ Dashboard UI – Overall Progress Section
🟦 Overall Progress Card

Large percentage value (e.g., 25% Overall Progress)

Circular or horizontal progress bar

Smooth animation

Updates instantly

🟩 Course-Wise Progress List (With Names)
Course Name	Progress
Web Development	45%
App Development	20%
Game Development	10%

Each course row includes:

⏸️ 4️⃣ Focus-Aware Progress Control (Important)
❌ Progress is NOT counted when:

Tab is switched

Browser window loses focus

Face not detected

Video auto-paused

User skips excessively

✅ System Behavior:

Video pauses

Timer pauses

Progress freezes

Last valid time is saved

When focus returns:

Video resumes

Timer resumes

Progress continues

📌 This ensures fair and accurate learning analytics.

🔁 5️⃣ Real-Time Update Mechanism
Progress updates when:

Valid watch time increases

Video completes

User resumes after pause

Next video auto-starts

Dashboard listens to:

Video time

Completion state

Course progress state

📌 No refresh needed — updates are live.

🧩 6️⃣ Simple System Flow

🎓 VIVA-READY SHORT EXPLANATION

“The dashboard displays real-time overall progress by analysing course-wise learning data. Each course’s progress is calculated from completed and partially watched videos. The overall progress is computed by averaging all course percentages and updates live while the user watches videos. Progress pauses automatically during focus loss, ensuring accurate learning analytics.”

Course progress and quiz availability update dynamically based on valid video engagement, ensuring disciplined and effective learning.”

AI MONITORING – WHAT IT DOES WITH THE CAMERA

The AI Monitoring system uses the laptop webcam to continuously analyze the student’s attention, presence, and behavior while a video is playing.

It works in real time and directly controls:

Video play / pause

Timer start / stop

Progress validation

Alerts & reports

Dashboard live status

🎥 1️⃣ CAMERA ACCESS & LIVE FEED
What it does

Requests webcam permission when Start Monitoring is clicked

Starts live video feed (not recorded, only processed)

Displays Camera On / Off status in the UI

Purpose

Enables AI-based face & attention analysis

Ensures the student is physically present

👤 2️⃣ FACE DETECTION (CORE FEATURE)
What the AI checks

Is a human face visible in the camera frame?

Is the face continuously present?

Behavior

✅ Face detected → Monitoring OK

❌ Face missing → Attention lost

Rules

If face is not detected:

Video auto-pauses

Timer pauses

Attention marked as Distracted

If face missing more than 10 times:

Video is marked INVALID

Progress not counted

Dashboard UI

Status: Face Detected (Green)

Or Not Detected (Red)

👀 3️⃣ ATTENTION / FOCUS DETECTION
What the AI checks

Is the face looking towards the screen?

Is the user present and not idle?

Combined with browser signals:

Tab active?

Window focused?

Camera on?

Behavior

Focused → Video plays, timer runs

Distracted → Video pauses, timer stops

Dashboard UI

Focused (Blue)

Distracted (Red)

🔄 4️⃣ TAB SWITCH & WINDOW BLUR DETECTION (CAMERA + BROWSER)

Even if the camera is ON:

If user:

Switches browser tab

Minimizes window

Moves to another app

System does

Video auto-pauses

Timer pauses

Logs an attention violation

📌 Camera + browser events together ensure true attention, not fake presence.

⏸️ 5️⃣ AUTO-PAUSE CONTROL (AI-DRIVEN)

The AI Monitoring system controls the video player.

Auto-pause triggers:

Face not detected

Tab switch

Window blur

Long inactivity

Auto-resume:

Only when:

Face detected again

Tab active

Monitoring active

📌 No manual cheating possible

⏱️ 6️⃣ VALID TIME COUNTING (VERY IMPORTANT)

The camera AI decides when time is counted.

Time is counted ONLY if:

✔ Camera ON
✔ Face detected
✔ Tab active
✔ Video playing

Time is NOT counted if:

❌ Camera off
❌ Face missing
❌ Tab switched
❌ Video paused

This guarantees fair progress calculation.

🚨 7️⃣ ALERT GENERATION (FROM CAMERA EVENTS)

Each AI violation creates alerts:

“Face not detected – video paused”

“Attention lost – tab switched”

“Repeated focus loss detected”

Alerts are:

Shown in UI

Logged in Firebase

Used for reports & evaluation

📊 8️⃣ DASHBOARD REAL-TIME STATUS (FROM CAMERA)

The AI Monitoring continuously updates:

Posture status (from ESP32)

Attention status (from camera + browser)

Face detection status

Monitoring Active / Inactive

All visible live on the dashboard.

🧠 AI MODELS USED (BROWSER-SAFE)

The system uses client-side AI, no server needed:

MediaPipe Face Detection

OR face-api.js

OR TensorFlow.js (lightweight models)

✔ Runs in browser
✔ No video stored
✔ Privacy friendly

🧑‍🎓 VIVA-READY SUMMARY (SHORT)

“AI Monitoring uses the webcam to detect face presence and attention in real time. If the face is not detected, the user switches tabs, or loses focus, the system automatically pauses the video and stops progress tracking. This ensures disciplined, focused, and fair digital learning.”
