To resolve the "failed to fetch" error for the face detection models, please follow these steps:

1.  **Download the models:** Go to the `face-api.js` models GitHub repository: `https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js-models`. Download the entire repository as a ZIP file.
2.  **Extract the models:** Unzip the downloaded file. Inside, you'll find a `weights` directory.
3.  **Place the models:** Copy *all* the model files (e.g., `.json` and `.weights` files) from the extracted `weights` directory into the `V:\work\fullstack\mega\student-learning-platform\public\models` directory.

    **Important:** Ensure the files are placed directly inside `public/models`, not in any subfolders within `public/models`. For example, `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json` and its corresponding `.weights` files should be directly in `V:\work\fullstack\mega\student-learning-platform\public\models`.

Once you have completed these steps, please let me know.
