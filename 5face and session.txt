Face Detection Details
How it works:
1. Camera Access - Uses your webcam via navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()
2. Face Detection - Uses face-api.js with TinyFaceDetector model
3. Detection Interval - Runs every 500ms (twice per second)
4. Result - Sets isFaceDetected to true if face found, false if not
Detection Process:
Camera Frame → face-api.js → Face Detection → isFaceDetected State
What triggers "No Face":
- Camera covered
- You look away
- You leave the computer
- Poor lighting
Time Counting Details
Session Timer Rule:
const canCountSession = 
  monitoringActive &&    // AI Monitoring started
  cameraActive &&        // Camera enabled
  isFaceDetected &&     // Face visible
  tabVisible &&          // Tab in focus
  videoPlaying &&       // Video playing
  !timeLimitReached    // Under 30 min limit
What stops the timer:
| Condition | Timer | Video |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Face hidden | ❌ Stops | ❌ Pauses |
| Tab switch | ❌ Stops | ❌ Pauses |
| Window loses focus | ❌ Stops | ❌ Pauses |
| Video paused | ❌ Stops | - |
| Camera off | ❌ Stops | ❌ Pauses |
| 30 min reached | ❌ Stops | ❌ Pauses |
Progress:
- Session time = only counts when ALL conditions are met
- Video progress = watch time / total duration
- Time limit = 30 minutes per video
VIVA-READY EXPLANATION
> "The system uses face-api.js with TinyFaceDetector for real-time face detection. Session time and progress are strictly controlled by a master enforcement flag that requires all conditions to be true: AI monitoring active, camera enabled, face detected, tab in focus, and video playing. If any condition fails, the timer stops immediately and video pauses, ensuring authentic learning time is recorded."
